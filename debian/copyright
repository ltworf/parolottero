                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007
 .
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
                            Preamble
 .
 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
 .
 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.
 .
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.
 .
 A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
 encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
 software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
 The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
 source code to the public.
 .
 The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
 ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
 to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
 provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
 users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
 a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
 code of the modified version.
 .
 An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
 published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
 a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
 released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
 this license.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
  0. Definitions.
 .
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
 .
 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 .
 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 .
 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.
 .
 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
 1. Source Code.
 .
 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.
 .
 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.
 .
 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.
 .
 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 same work.
 .
  2. Basic Permissions.
 .
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 .
 You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 makes it unnecessary.
 .
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 .
 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.
 .
 When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 technological measures.
 .
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 .
 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 .
 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
 .
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".
 .
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.
 .
 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 parts of the aggregate.
 .
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 .
 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 in one of these ways:
 .
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.
 .
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
 .
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.
 .
 A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 included in conveying the object code work.
 .
 A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
 "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 modification has been made.
 .
 If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 been installed in ROM).
 .
 The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 protocols for communication across the network.
 .
 Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
  7. Additional Terms.
 .
 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
 When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 .
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 .
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 .
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or
 .
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.
 .
 All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
 If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 where to find the applicable terms.
 .
 Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 the above requirements apply either way.
 .
  8. Termination.
 .
 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 paragraph of section 11).
 .
 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 material under section 10.
 .
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 .
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
 An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 .
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 .
  11. Patents.
 .
 A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 .
 A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 this License.
 .
 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 .
 In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 patent against the party.
 .
 If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
 If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 work and works based on it.
 .
 A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 .
 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 .
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 .
 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
 .
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
 Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
 interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
 supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
 Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
 from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
 means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
 shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
 following paragraph.
 .
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
 14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 to choose that version for the Program.
 .
 Later license versions may give you additional or different
 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 later version.
 .
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
 network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
 get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
 interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
 of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
 solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
 specific requirements.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

 Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL)
 .
 Sat Dec 5 16:06:29 2020 -0500 [e88aed5]
 by Kevin Atkinson (kevina@gnu.org)
 .
 The SCOWL is a collection of word lists split up in various sizes, and
 other categories, intended to be suitable for use in spell checkers.
 However, I am sure it will have numerous other uses as well.
 .
 The latest version can be found at http://wordlist.aspell.net/.
 .
 The directory final/ contains the actual word lists broken up into
 various sizes and categories.  The r/ directory contains Readmes from
 the various sources used to create this package.
 .
 The misc/ contains a small list of taboo words, see the README file
 for more info.  The speller/ directory contains scripts for creating
 spelling dictionaries for Aspell and Hunspell.
 .
 The other directories contain the necessary information to recreate the
 word lists from the raw data.  Unless you are interested in improving the
 words lists you should not need to worry about what's here.  See the
 section on recreating the words lists for more information on what's
 there.
 .
 Except for the special word lists the files follow the following
 naming convention:
   <spelling category>-<sub-category>.<size>
 Where the spelling category is one of
   english, american, british, british_z, canadian, australian
   variant_1, variant_2, variant_3,
   british_variant_1, british_variant_2,
   canadian_variant_1, canadian_variant_2,
   australian_variant_1, australian_variant_2
 Sub-category is one of
   abbreviations, contractions, proper-names, upper, words
 And size is one of
   10, 20, 35 (small), 40, 50 (medium), 55, 60, 70 (large),
   80 (huge), 95 (insane)
 The special word lists follow are in the following format:
   special-<description>.<size>
 Where description is one of:
   roman-numerals, hacker
 .
 The perl script "mk-list" can be used to create a word list of the
 desired size, its usage is:
   ./mk-list [-f] [-v#] <spelling categories> <size>
 where <spelling categories> is one of the above spelling categories
 (the english and special categories are automatically included as well
 as all sub-categories) and <size> is the desired size.  The
 "-v" option can be used to also include the appropriate
 variants file up to level '#'.  The normal output will be a sorted
 word list.  If you rather see what files will be included, use the
 "-f" option.
 .
 When manually combining the words lists the "english" spelling
 category should be used as well as one of "american", "british",
 "british_z" (british with ize spelling), "canadian" or "australian".
 Great care has been taken so that only one spelling for any particular
 word is included in the main list (with some minor exceptions).  When
 two variants were considered equal I randomly picked one for inclusion
 in the main word list.  Unfortunately this means that my choice in how
 to spell a word may not match your choice.  If this is the case you
 can try including one of the "variant_1" spelling categories which
 includes most variants which are considered almost equal.  The
 "variant_1" spelling category corresponds mostly to American variants,
 while the "british_variant_1", "canadian_variant_1" and
 "australian_variant_1" are for British, Canadian and Australian
 variants, respectively.  The "variant_2" spelling categories include
 variants which are also generally considered acceptable, and
 "variant_3" contains variants which are seldom used and may not even
 be considered correct.  There is no "british_variant_3",
 "canadian_variant_3" or "australian_variant_3" spelling category since
 the distinction would be almost meaningless.
 .
 The "abbreviation" category includes abbreviations and acronyms which
 are not also normal words. The "contractions" category should be self
 explanatory. The "upper" category includes upper case words and proper
 names which are common enough to appear in a typical dictionary. The
 "proper-names" category includes all the additional uppercase words.
 Finally the "words" category contains all the normal English words.
 .
 To give you an idea of what the words in the various sizes look like
 here is a sample of 25 random words found only in that size:
 .
 10: actually advance affecting byte character children deals deleted
     desirable distributing exact ignored justifies literally odd plans reads
     regardless sadly seeming serving strange switch thing typing

     thyroparathyroidectomize
 .
 .
 And here is a count on the number of words in each spelling category
 (american + english spelling category):
 .
   Size   Words       Names    Running Total  %
    10    4,425          13        4,438     0.7
    20    8,126           0       12,564     1.9
    35   37,260         220       50,044     7.6
    40    6,858         489       57,391     8.7
    50   25,289      18,683      101,363    15.4
    55    6,487           0      107,850    16.4
    60   14,552         850      123,252    18.7
    70   35,294       7,897      166,443    25.3
    80  144,164      33,368      343,975    52.3
    95  227,630      86,630      658,235   100.0
 .
 .
 (The "Words" column does not include the name count.)
 .
 Size 35 is the recommended small size, 50 the medium and 70 the large.
 Sizes 70 and below contain words found in most dictionaries while the
 80 size contains all the strange and unusual words people like to use
 in word games such as Scrabble (TM).  While a lot of the words in the
 80 size are not used very often, they are all generally considered
 valid words in the English language.  The 95 contains just about every
 English word in existence and then some.  Many of the words at the 95
 level will probably not be considered valid English words by most
 people.
 .
 For spell checking I recommend using size 60.  This size is the
 largest size that I am fairly confident does not contain any
 misspellings or invalid words.  In addition an effort is made to
 exclude valid yet problematic words (such as "calender") from the 60
 size that are likely to be a misspelling of a more common word.  The
 70 size is reasonable for those wanting a larger list and don't mind a
 few errors.  The 80 or larger sizes are not reasonable for spell
 checking.
 .
 Accents are present on certain words such as café in iso8859-1 format.

 .
   Updated to the latest version of many of the source dictionaries.
 .
   Removed the DEC Word List due to the questionable licence and

 .
   Added a large number of Uppercase words to the 50 level.
 .

   There were many many sources in total, but any text marked

 The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.

 The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at

 The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0
 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the
 public domain.
 .
 The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words appearing
 in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts
 package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12
 dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The
 top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
 list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
 myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
 other word lists is included.
 .
 The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
 don't think can be copyrighted.
 .
 The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
 "Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon
 File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain
 a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the
 special/ directory.
 .
 The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
 4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also
 in the public domain.
 .
 The 60 level includes all words appearing in at least 2 of the 12
 dictionaries as indicated by the 12Dicts package.
 .
 The 70 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and the 74,550 common
 dictionary words from the MWords package.  The common dictionary words,
 like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections
 added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of
 the 12Dics package which is in the public domain.
 .
 The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
 ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics
 Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words from the YAWL package,
 and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.
 .
 The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,
 is in the Public Domain:

   The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released
   into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in
   any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its
   use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely
   must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of
   the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your
   favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble
   community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers
   may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please
   mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note
   that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,
   you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
   legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
   WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your
   rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.

 The variant word lists were created from a list of variants found in
 the 12dicts supplement package as well as a list of variants I created
 myself.
 .
 The Readmes for the various packages used can be found in the
 appropriate directory under the r/ directory.
 .
 FUTURE PLANS:
 .
 The process of "sort"s, "comm"s, and Perl scripts to combine the many
 word lists and separate out the variant information is inexact and
 error prone.  The whole things needs to be rewritten to deal with
 words in terms of lemmas.  When the exact lemma is not known a best
 guess should be made.  I'm not sure what form this should be in.  I
 originally thought this should be some sort of database, but maybe I
 should just slurp all that data into memory and process it in one
 giant perl script.  With the amount of memory available these days (at
 least 2 GB, often 4 GB or more) this should not really be a problem.
 .
 In addition, there is a very nice frequency analyze of the BNC corpus
 done by Adam Kilgarriff.  Unlike Brian's word lists the BNC lists
 include part of speech information.  I plan on somehow using these
 lists as Adam Kilgarriff has given me the OK to use it in SCOWL.
 These lists will greatly reduce the problem of inflected forms of a
 word appearing at different levels due to the part-of-speech
 information.
 .
 There is frequency information for some other corpus such as COCA
 (Corpus of Contemporary American English) and ANS (American National
 Corpus) which I might also be able to use.  The former will require
 permission, and the latter is of questionable quality.
 .
 RECREATING THE WORD LISTS:
 .
 In order to recreate the word lists you need a modern version of Perl,
 bash, the traditional set of shell utilities, a system that supports
 symbolic links, and quite possibly GNU Make.  The easiest way to
 recreate the word lists is to checkout the corresponding Git version
 (see the version string at the start of the file) and simply type
 "make" (see http://wordlist.aspell.net).  You can try to download all
 the pieces manually, but this method is not no longer tested nor
 supported.
 .
 The src/ directory contains the numerous scripts used in the creation
 of the final product.
 .
 The r/ directory contains the raw data used to create the final
 product.  If you checkout from Git this directory should be populated
 automatically for you.  If you insist on doing it the hard way see the
 README file in the r/ directory for more information.
 .
 The l/ directory contains symbolic links used by the actual scripts.
 .
 Finally, the working/ directory is where all the intermittent files go
 that are not specific to one source.
