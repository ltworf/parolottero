parolottero (2.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Fix upstream url in d/copyright
  * Language data files are now in a different project
    so that someone in FTPmaster will hopefully approve this package
    even though the data files were generated by other data files
    already shipped by Debian.
